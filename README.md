This project is the code of the Zero to App course.

## What you need

Make sure you have Node.js installed (check how to on the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) website)

Once you can run the `npm` command in the console, get back here.

## Install the dependencies

Run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder to download all the Node packages the project needs.

It might take a while.

> You might also need to run `npm install websocket-driver` if you run into problems.

## Start the app

Run `npm start` in the `frontend` folder. The app should start on port 3000 and the browser will open automatically on that page.

Backend coming soon.
